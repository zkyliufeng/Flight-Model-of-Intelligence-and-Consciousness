Flight Model: New Explorations into the Fundamental Principles of Intelligence and Consciousness<Br>

Abstract:<Br>
Constructing the fundamental principles of intelligence and consciousness has become a significant scientific challenge. The literature indicates that current theories of intelligence and consciousness have yet to provide comprehensive answers regarding the unified structure, objectives, and significance of the entities generating intelligence and consciousness, the driving forces, the relationship between intelligence and consciousness, and the distinctions between different types of consciousness.This study extends von Neumann architecture to establish Standard Agent Model as an axiom, proposing that any system (agent) possesses five essential capabilities: knowledge input, output, storage, creation, and control over the use of these capabilities. By taking the maximum and minimum values for each of these five capabilities, two extreme states and two types of intelligence forces of the agent are derived. Inspired by the principles of flight, the above elements are combined to establish the "Flight Model (FM)" of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence is defined as the agent's ability to utilize the five capabilities comprehensively to evolve between the two extreme states under the influence of intelligence forces. Consciousness is defined as the agent's ability to control the use of intelligence under the influence of the two types of intelligence forces. Based on the relationship between control and being controlled, consciousness is further subdivided into self-consciousness, other-consciousness, mix consciousness, and unconsciousness.This study evaluates the intelligence levels and self-consciousness of different agents based on FM theoretical framework. The results show that current artificial intelligence systems exhibit intelligence close to adult human levels but have not yet demonstrated self-consciousness. This study constructs a theoretical system of intelligence and consciousness, providing a theoretical basis for determining the timeline for achieving AGI and addressing AI self-consciousness issues.
